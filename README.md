# **DYNAMIC PRICING**

In today’s highly volatile market environment, setting the right price at the right time is critical to maximizing profit margins. Traditional pricing strategies are no longer sufficient in the face of rapid changes in demand, supply chain disruptions, and fluctuating economic indicators.

Dynamic Pricing emerges as a powerful solution, leveraging data-driven models to adjust prices based on a combination of internal and external factors. Internally, this includes basic variables such as purchase cost and sales volume over time, as well as more complex metrics like price elasticity. Externally, macroeconomic variables such as inflation, weather patterns, and holidays have a significant impact on consumer behavior and product demand.

This project proposes a data-driven Dynamic Pricing system that leverages supervised Machine Learning techniques to model and predict optimal selling prices. The approach integrates:
- Basic internal features, such as historical sales volume per period and acquisition cost;
- Advanced internal variables, including price elasticity of demand;
- External drivers, such as inflation indices, weather conditions, and holidays — all of which have measurable effects on consumer behavior.

By incorporating both internal operational metrics and exogenous market signals, the model aims to generate pricing recommendations that adapt to market conditions in real time, maximizing revenue while maintaining competitiveness.

## **PROJECT OBJECTIVE**

The goal of this project is to develop a predictive pricing model capable of supporting dynamic pricing strategies in a retail environment. The model is designed to estimate optimal product prices by learning from both internal historical performance data and external contextual variables.

Key objectives include:
- Preprocessing and feature engineering to consolidate sales, cost, weather, inflation, and calendar data into a structured format suitable for modeling;
- Exploration of price elasticity and its integration as a derived feature to inform pricing sensitivity;
- Training supervised learning models to predict optimal selling prices that balance competitiveness and profitability;
- Validation using appropriate cross-validation techniques, accounting for seasonality and potential data imbalance.

This solution aims to serve as a robust foundation for real-time, automated pricing systems that respond dynamically to market conditions.
